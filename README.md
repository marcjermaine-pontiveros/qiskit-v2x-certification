## About Qiskit v2.x Certification

The Qiskit v2.x Certification validates expertise in IBM's Qiskit quantum computing framework, focusing on version 2.x features. The certification covers a range of topics essential for quantum circuit development, execution, and optimization.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Operators and Quantum Operations**: Understanding Pauli operators, SparsePauliOp for Hamiltonians, and the Operator class for matrix representations.
- **Visualization**: Circuit drawing with Matplotlib, plotting measurement counts, and Bloch sphere representations for quantum states.
- **Circuit Construction**: Building basic circuits, parameterized circuits with Parameter, and dynamic circuits using conditional if_test.
- **Transpilation and Optimization**: Mapping circuits to backend constraints, routing with SWAPs, basis gate decomposition, and optimization levels.
- **Execution Modes**: Job, session, and batch modes for running circuits on IBM Quantum hardware.
- **Runtime Primitives**: SamplerV2 for measurement outcomes and EstimatorV2 for expectation values, including resilience levels and error mitigation.
- **Job Management and Interoperability**: Retrieving and monitoring jobs, exporting to OpenQASM 2/3, and REST API interactions.

This repository provides practice materials, including an interactive quiz, to help you prepare for the exam.
